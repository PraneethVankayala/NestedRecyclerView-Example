3.Navigate to the directory where you saved the this project, select the root folder of the project (the folder named "NestedRecyclerView-Example"), and hit OK. Android Studio should now begin building the project with Gradle

4.Once this process is complete and Android Studio opens, check the Console for any build errors.
